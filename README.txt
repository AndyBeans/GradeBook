I've started a very basic Pluralsight C# course, aiming to whizz through to more interesting stuff. Bear with me if 
anything seems awry, I've been programming for decades but haven't done much outside SAS and web coding for a long while.

So far so good, I've made a couple of additions to the basic Hello World but mostly been confused by GitHub, this text file
went missing for a while. No sign of any whizzing yet.
